## System Requirements
NOTE: This is a newly developed script especially for Ubuntu 20.04 x64 VPS machine. Further adaptation will be added for other environment and usage scenario.

## Features
* This script assumes you have a VPS and a domain name pointing to the IP address of the VPS. The script will ask for the domain name and write into `~/mysite/Caddyfile`. Caddy will then automatically get a certification and a key for you, which will be stored in `$HOME/.local/share/caddy/certificates/`. The `.crt` and `.key` will be searched and filled into `/etc/aria2/aria2.conf`, which will enable you to access aria2 through HTTPS.

* The latest File Browser version is v2.5.0, which is capable of playing `mp4` video online and auto-detect and use `.vtt` subtitle in the same folder.
